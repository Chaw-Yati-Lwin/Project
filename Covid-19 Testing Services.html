    <h1>Covid-19 Facts</h1><br>
    <h2>What is Covid 19?</h2><br>
    <p>COVID-19 is a type (strain) of coronavirus. A virus is a very small (microscopic) type of germ that can cause an infection.It can only<br> replicate in a host, such as a person or other living things. You might not always feel sick from viruses. However, viruses can make<br> you seriously ill and cause disease.<br>The disease caused by this virus has different names. The disease is called COVID-19 – Coronavirus Disease 2019 for the year in which<br> it first apered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing,<br> hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.</p><br><br>

    <h2>How did the coronavirus start?</h2><br>
    <p>The first case of COVID-19 was reported Dec. 1, 2019, and the cause was a then-new coronavirus later named SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2<br> may have originated in an animal and changed (mutated) so it could cause illness in humans. In the past, several infectious disease outbreaks<br> have been traced to viruses originating in birds, pigs, bats and other animals that mutated to become dangerous to humans. Research continues,<br> and more study may reveal how and why the coronavirus evolved to cause pandemic disease.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Covid-19 Testing</h1><br>

    <h2>When to get tested for Covid-19</h2><br>

    <h3>If you have symptoms</h3><br>
    <p>Vaccinated or not, get tested immediately if you’re feeling any COVID-19 symptoms. If an antigen test is negative, take another in<br>24-48 hours, as early cases can be missed.</p><br>

    <h3>If you were exposed</h3><br>
    <p>Anyone exposed should consider getting tested as soon as possible, even if you have no symptoms.<br><br>

    Test again 5 days after exposure.</p><br>


    <h3>If you go to a high-rish event</h3><br>
    <p>Test before and 3-5 days after.<br>


    For mega-events of more than 1,000 people, it’s strongly recommended to test 1 day (antigen test) <br>or 2 days (PCR test) before the event.</p><br>

    <h3>If you travel</h3><br>
    <p>Test before travel, and 3-5 days after.<br><br>

    Vaccinated or not, anyone entering or re-entering California should test 3-5 days after arrival.</p><br>

    <h2>Four Steps of Covid-19 Test</h2><br>

    <h3>Before the test</h3><br>
    <p>You must bring a form of identification with you to your appointment such as a ID, Driver Licenses or passport  to confirm your identity.<br>All paitents should wear a mask and arrive five minutes before their scheduled time.</p><br>

    <h3>When you arrive</h3><br>
    <p>You will be directed to line up and verify your name and date of birth. If walk-up, please maintain 6 feet of distance from other individuals.<br> If driving, remain in your car with your windows closed until a healthcare professional signals you to lower your car window.</p><br>

    <h3>During the test</h3><br>
    <p>Some locations are directed and assisted swab sites, where individuals conduct their own swab, while being supervised by a <br> healthcare provider.</p><br>

    <p>The UW Medical Center - Northwest and Harborview sites will have a healthcare provider conduct the swab. A healthcare provider<br> will put a cotton swab up both nostrils, one after the other, for 10-15 seconds each. The process can be uncomfortable but is rarely painful.<br> Some patients experience a slight nosebleed, which can be controlled using tissue and pressure.</p><br>

    <h3>After the test</h3><br>
    <p>You will be given a QR (quick response) code. This code allows you to use a computer or mobile device to go online and access your<br> test results. Please wait 72 hours before calling the laboratory if you haven’t received your results.<br><br>

    While you're waiting for test results, if you have been exposed to someone with COVID or are experiencing COVID-like symptoms,<br> you should self-quarantine at home. For more information on what to do while you wait, read our follow-up instructions.<br><br>

    If your COVID-19 test result is positive or inconclusive, a healthcare provider will call you to let you know.<br><br>

    For test results within King County, if patients are having trouble accessing their results, they can call 206.477.3977 between <br>8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Interpretation is available.</p><br><br>
